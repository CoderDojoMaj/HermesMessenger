# HermesMessenger
This is the project we made for the 2019 Coolest Projects International. As it is a big
project, we created a separate organization for it.   
You can find the organization [here](https://github.com/HermesMessenger) and the project itself [here](https://hermesmessenger.chat). The main repo is [this one](https://github.com/HermesMessenger/Hermes)
